This project utilizes the Hogwarts/Harry Potter API at "https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters" which organizes data on characters from the Harry Potter/ Wizarding World Universe in the JSON object format.
This project utilizes Python and GET requests to offer users multiple quizzes to find out their Hogwarts house, their Wizard Wand, and their patronus.
The website is deployed and designed using Streamlit for frontend design with Python. The quizzes offer multiple input sources including text-fields, radio buttons, sliders, and dropdown menus.
The final product can be accessed at "https://agopal45lab03hp.streamlit.app/", which may take a minute to load in the case of inactivity.
